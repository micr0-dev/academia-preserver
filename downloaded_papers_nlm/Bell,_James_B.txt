PREFACE. 

I HIS little work was prepared for my own use, as a labor-saver, and as a receptacle for clinical ovations, and for gleanings from others and q the periodicals. 

¦as been the work of odd moments; and little nts of time, redeemed from busy days. 

EiVen the young physician, of a single summer's erience, must have felt the want of such a k, particularly when dealing with the frently occurring and obstinate diarrhoeas of ins. It was the difficulty of treating these, that awakened the desire to possess in one little k all that was known of our Materia Medica pplied to loose evacuations of the bowels. 

Eias not been intended to include every remat has been known to purge, but only every t of which enough is known, either of its or conditions, or concomitants, to distinguish i any other remedy. 

¦some may inquire, Why should diseases of wels be honored above others by a special raph ? 

iii 



lhose who have Bcenninghausen on Cough, on Fever, and on Headache, will not ask this question, but will desire that the work go on until we possess such special aids in the treatment of all affections that most tax the busy practitioner. 

The present work is now printed because colleagues, who had seen it, desired to possess a copy  one going so far as to copy it himself,  because Mr. Tafel, who had seen it, desired to print it, and because the work had already repaid me for the time and labor it cost, in the same coin, and I was therefore happy to believe that it would be of like use to others. The clinical test will be found to disclose many valuable symptoms not to be met with elsewhere, and, alas, also, doubtless, many errors. 

Eie carefully collated experience of ten active i, which it contains, would indeed be better ey were twenty or thirty, but perhaps the . in his goodness will permit this to be added 

E would be a grateful task to indicate throughle work, the sources from which many valuymptoms were drawn, but this would detract its practical character as a work of reference.

INTRODUCTION. 

CHARACTER AND OBJECT OF THE WORK. 

THIS work is intended to apply to all loose evacuations of the bowels, and to describe them, their aggravations and ameliorations, with their immediate accompaniments and general accompanying synip- 

¦ character of the stool is used as an adjective, er it the word " stool " is always to be under- The semicolon stands for it. 

Eder the head of aggravations and ameliorations influences are given which affect the stool, and hose which act as exciting causes of the attack, i referring to other symptoms, they will be found ,ted in parenthesis. 

¦ concomitants of the stool have been studied served with much care. 

¦general accompaniments include all the syniplat occur during the attack. 

¦sr each of the be^st known remedies, some ms will be found italicised. These, it will be ood, are th 3 symptoms which have been most 



sharply distinguish that remedy from others. The more of these emphasized symptoms we have under any one remedy, the easier the selection. The sooner we are able by careful observation to emphasize symptoms under all our remedies, the more we shall perfect our art. It should be the self-appointed task of every Homoeopathic physician, to confirm, and define, and add to, the symptoms of all our remedies, but more especially of those that are but little known. Many of that class will be found in this book, some of which have many symptoms of clear and distinctive character, derived from provings, but whose relative and positive value awaits clinical determination. If those who use this book will add the fruits of their observations, by underlining and writing-in symptoms, they will be gladly incorporated in a future edition, should any be required. 

B remarks, which follow nearly every remedy, oe understood as embodying only the personal s of the writer, whether confirming or conng what may have been published by others, ped that they may sometimes aid in the seof the remedy, but they are of wholly sub-3 authority to the text. 

THE SELECTION OF THE REMEDY. 

All who subscribe to the law of similars, agree that the problem in each case is to find a reme- 

6 







One class thinks the solution is found in a similitude to the pathological state. If able to diagnose hyperaemia, hyperassthesia, ulceration, plastic exu-^ dation, atony, atrophy, hypertrophy, and so on through the catalogue, this seems to them sufficient. They have then only to diagnose a remedy producing a similar state. This has a great fascination for some excellent minds, because it seems to utilize the splendid developments of Allopathy in this direction, and connect them directly with therapeutics. 

Another, and growing class, believes that those who stop here will never comprehend the true genius of Homoeopathy. The demand for exactness, minuteness, and delicacy of observation in all branches of science was never greater. The same is true of Homoeopathic Therapeutics. Those who are ardently following in this direction, soon discover that the selection of the remedy requires, so to speak, two similars, viz., one corresponding to the general symptoms, or those which bring it into relation to the pathological state to be treated, and one corresponding to the special and characteristic symptoms, or those which bring it into relation with the individual case to be treated. 

To illustrate: a patient has stools consisting of bloody mucus, small and frequent, with tenesmus. We diagnose dysentery ; hypereemia and inflammaudation 

7 





01 blood, and secretion of mucus. Forty four volunteers stand ready, armed and equipped with a similar pathological condition. But we want but one, and how shall we learn which one ? We must be more exact, and discover that our patient has restlessness, dry heat, and much thirst. Our volunteers are now reduced to three ; but still too many. Applying our magnifying-glass again, we observe a recent exposure to cold, dry wind, and a flushed face becoming pale, with faintness, on rising, and now we have the man we want. 

Eiecomes evident, therefore, that the individualsymptoms possess the greater value, and are, I, indispensable to a certain selection. 

It should be noticed, further, that these distinguishing symptoms are of all kinds and qualities, from the most purely objective and pathological, to the most subjective and delicate complaints which the organism is capable of uttering. As instances of the former may be cited, the green frothy stools of Magn. c, the dark acid urine of Benz. Ac, the blue varices of Mur. Ac, and of the latter, the aggravation from hearing water run, of Hydroph., from sudden depressing emotions, of Gels., and the relief, from cold food and drink, of Phos. 

E whatever the character of these symptoms, particular, it is to be observed that they are evjr obtrusive enough to thrust themselves he notice of an unobserving man, and that 

8 







This mode of diagnosing the remedy is also in exact accordance with that pursued in other sciences. The chemist would be thought hardly worthy of his title, who should attempt to recognize arsenic by its cruder properties of color, weight, or taste. He must be familiar with its most delicate and characteristic tests and reactions. He does not ignore the other properties, yet it is only after applying the characteristic tests that he will give an authoritative decision, and on these he will rely, even in cases involving weighty questions of human guilt or innocence. 

But now the question arises, and it is a very important and practical one : suppose we find that the only remedy for a given case, that corresponds to the peculiar and individualizing symptoms, is one that has never been known to cause the pathological state under which our patient suffers. The answer is, that we may safely infer that the remedy does possess also the general and organic symptoms of the case, and that it will remove them, together with the distinguishing indications. 

Thus has our Materia Medica been enriched by at least one fourth of the most positive and valuable pathological symptoms which we possess. Thus, for example, have we learned that Bry. Ars., Rhus., Bap , etc. have ulceration of Peyer's glands in their pathogenesis ; that Hep., Lach., and Lye. produce pseudo-membranous exudation ; that Spong. causes 

9 





fuul cures plastic cnolo-carditis i or tout ft iact now published for the first time and obtained purely by observing the characteristic symptoms) Puls., and Sep. are known to cause and cure trachoma or granular conjunctivitis. 

I some affect to sneer at this method, and only time ago the author had the honor to acquire iable title, because he had observed the power oph. to cure true pneumonia when selected by haracteristic symptoms, although it has never nown to produce that condition. 

Yet here, too, we are following closely the example of the chemist, who from the yellow band in the spectrum is able to assert that there is sodium in the sun, or from the lines in the spectrum of the Diirkheim spring-water, is able to declare that a new metal is there. He does not hesitate to attribute form, weight, malleability, and other metallic properties to the stranger, long "before he is able to possess himself of a little bar of Indium. 

Our conclusion, then, is, that the problem of selection is solved by seeking the remedy which possesses the physical and diagnostic symptoms of the case, and which corresponds also to the special, distinguishing, and peculiar symptoms which mark the individual case. And, further, if a remedy is found that possesses distinctly the latter symptoms, but not, so far as is known, the former, we may conclude safely that it does possess the former, and administer it with conndjnce. 

10 





THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE REMEDY. 

¦he present state of our science upon this each can only contribute the fruits of his )servation. 

The writer began the practice of medicine with the pi'econceived idea strongly fixed in his mind, that, while the thirtieth potency might be useful and perhaps the best for chronic and nervous affections, the lower and even crude preparations would prove more satisfactory for acute affections and particularly for diseases of the bowels. 

¦ experience has taught him the contrary, and " convinced against his will," he is not " of c opinion still." 

Be is indeed a somewhat prevalent opinion, c strength of the dose makes up for want of c or knowledge in selection. 

¦ may be stated in mathematical terms as folif the thirtieth potency of Ars. is equal to a te knowledge of the drug, one-fifth of a grain nious acid is equal to complete ignorance of ated in this, its true form, we grant it. 

¦onally, our experience has been most satisfacith the use of the twelfth, fifteenth, thirtieth, ndredth,* and often higher potencies, of our 

 The two hundredth proves more useful than anything lower, and we prefer it, but, until recently, many valuable remedies were 

11 





one to six hours according to the urgency of the symptoms, and suspended as soon as decided improvement appeared. If the same remedy was needed to be resumed again, it has seemed to do better in a higher potency, but on this point we cannot yet speak with entire assurance. 

We have not been able to perceive that age or sex or habits, (we might add color, race, or order in natural history,) form any element in the choice of the dose. All classes have been found to respond favorably to the high potencies. As regards temperament, we cannot speak with equal positiveness, but we have no certain testimon} r proving it to form an 

Note.  The question of diet is foreign to this work, but we cannot resist recording our testimony against the prevalent abuse, of starving infants and young children on arrowroot and other starch. They must have bread and beef. The latter is best assimilated in the form of an extract prepared in vacuo, by some reliable house.* Raw beef is next to be preferred, if the other cannot be obtained. The juice running out of a rare roast is also excellent. Ordinary beef-tea requires too high a temperature, in its preparation, coagulating the juices.

PART I. 

THE REMEDIES AND THEIR INDICATIONS. 

1. ACONITE. 

Stool: Watery; Bloody, slimy, mucous; Small; Frequent; (dysenteric stool.) 

¦ravation : In summer, with cold nights : After * wet: After being overheated: After exposcold, dry wind, or a draft: After anger or 

lioration: After eating warm soup  (pains.) re Stool: Cutting pains: Nausea and sweat. 

During Stool: Cutting pains ; Tenesmus. 

¦r Stool : Relief, except from nausea and sweat, may continue. 

Accompaniments: Anxiety; fear of death. Restlessness; Vertigo or fainting on rising up, with paleness, face flushed when lying. Bitter taste of everything except water. Lips dry, dark. Unquenchable thirst. Nausea. Vomiting: of blood; of 



with profuse sweat and urine. Sensation of a cold stone in the stomach. Distended abdomen sensitive to the touch. Violent pains (cutting) in the ab- 

¦splessness. General dry heat. Full, hard, very pulse. Internal shuddering, with dry, hot md tendency to uncover. Sweat on the covarts. 

Aeon. is only useful in the very beginning of acute diseases of the bowels, but is then often able to cut short dysentery, and even cholera morbus, without any other remedy. 

2. -dSTHUSA CYNAP. 

Stool: Bilious, light yellow, and greenish (liquid); Green mucous; Bloody mucous; 

¦"avation : In the morning (after rising) : In n : In summer : During dentition. 

¦>re Stool : Pinching and cutting pains in the en. 

Bng Stool : Tenesmus, often violent. 1 Stool : Unsatisfied urging to stool. 

Accompaniments : Irritability, bad humor, especially afternoons and in the open air. Sensation as though the head, and other parts, were in a vice. Face pale or flushed, altered ; collapsed, with an expression of anguish. Constant thirst. Violent vomiting of curdled milk ; of greenish mucus ; of frothy milky-white substance. 

14 





Eor. Spasms: thumbs clenched; eyes turned pupils fixed, dilated ; eyes staring ; foam at th; red face; locked jaw; pulse small, hard, ick. Drowsiness with chilliness. Great pros- 

jEthus. is suitable to a severe form of cholera infantum. It will usually be hardly able to complete the cure alone, but will need to be followed by an antipsoric ; most frequently by psor., sep., or sulph. 

3. AGARICUS. 

B: Thin, yellow, fecal, and slimy ; Watery ; vation : In wet weather: (general condition.) 

Before Stool: Pinching and cutting in the ab-

After Stool : Smarting in the anus. 

|>mpaniments: Mental excitability. Vertigo morning ; in the open air ; in the bright sun. coated tongue. Acrid, offensive smell from >uth, like horseradish. Passage of much flaiclling like garlic. Sleepiness in the daytime, 

There has been but little clinical experience with agar. in diarrhoea. It resembles natr. sulph. in its symptoms. The absence of the morning aggrava. tion in the former, is a marked distinction. 

15 





4. ALOE. 

El : Yellow fecal ; Bloody, jelly-like mucous ; ish, greenish, or bright yellow bilious ; Gray; Jndigested;  Involuntary; {when, expelling or urine.) Small ; (dysenteric stool.)

THEIR INDICATION'S. 

the liver. Griping pains in abdomen, relieved by bending double, with urging to stool, nothing but flatulence being passed. Much flatulence moving about in the abdomen. Pain in bowels after eating. Loud gurgling in the abdomen as of water running out of a. bottle. Distended abdomen. Flatus smells very badly, and causes burning in the rectum. Urine generally profuse. Chilliness when leaving the fire. 

Bes is one of our most valuable remedies for liarrhcea and dysentery. The symptoms are i and unmistakable, as given above. Con;o what might be expected, the peculiar gurin the abdomen is often found with the dysenteric stool, when aloes is indicated. The good appetite is most frequently met with among children. The haemorrhoids differ from those of brom. in the relief from cold water. 

5. ALUMINA. 

Stool: Thin fecal ; Expulsion difficult; 

ligravation : After constipation : After dinner : r lead-poisoning : During typhoid fever : In dry her : When walking : On alternate days : (gen« condition.) 

¦ioration : After short sleep : From warm apns: (colic.) 

Before Stool : Colic 

Kg Stool : Colic : Tenesmus : Burning in the Involuntary urnation.

Accompaniments : Seriousness. Changeable mood. Reeling vertigo in the morning, with faintness or nausea. Appetite for chalk, starch, clean white rags, charcoal, cloves, acids, ground coffee, tea-grounds, dry rice, and other unnatural and indigestible substances. Faintness at the stomach, relieved by satisfying the depraved cravings. Violent colic. Urine can only be passed with the stool. General debility. Chlorosis. 

Alum, is sometimes useful in acute diarrhoea, and, possibly, dysentery, when the difficult expulsion of stool and urine exist. It is more frequently indicated in chronic diarrhoea accompanying chlorosis, with the depraved appetite and the aggravation on alternate days. With these symptoms, a brilliant cure may be expected, including the chlorosis, if the remedy is not given too low, and too frequently.

limpaniments : Fretfulness. Bitter taste in mth, and bitter eructations passing off after something. Loss of appetite. Nausea, after and when walking in the open air. Pinching imen, hindering inspiration. Much rumbling ission of flatus. 

I[. m. is useful for chronic diarrhoea occurring the menses, when the other symptoms cor-1. Many of the symptoms resemble those of but are milder. The green mucous stool may it useful in infantile diarrhoea, but experience, se in this affection, is yet wanting. 

7. ANTIMON. CRUD. 

¦I : Watery ; Often profuse ; Alternating with ation ; 

¦avation : After acids, (vinegar, sour wine) ; verheating: After bathing : After cold water food : In aged persons : During pregnancy : it : Early in the morning. 

Before Stool : Cutting pains.

Accompaniments : Sentimental or distrustful mood. Children cannot bear being touched or looked at. Ptyalism, with saltish taste. Thirst, worse at night, Tongue coated white. Violent vomiting : bitter; of bile ; of slimy mucus : renev)ed on taking food or drink. Desire for acids. Frequent and profuse 

19 





The gastric symptoms of antimon. crtjd. pre« dominate. The vomiting differs from that of aeon., ars., verat., and other remedies, in the absence of severe thirst, and in the white-coated tongue. From want of attention to these distinctions, this remedy is often overlooked when it would bring speedy re-

20 





Hands blue. Emaciation. Indescribable feeling of weakness. Anasarca. Ascites. 

Apis, deserves further clinical observation, particularly in infantile diarrhoea, and cholera infantum. Here it is one of our precious remedies, corresponding to a low and dangerous condition. The absence of thirst, existing with a dry tongue and dry, hot skin, is sufficiently striking to prevent confounding it with other remedies with similar stools. When oedema is present, it will be most frequently found in the feet and genitals.

Dry heat. Great weakness ; fainting ; rapid exhaustion. Very rapid and scarcely perceptible pulse. Emaciation. 

There is reason to fear, that, as routine is easier than study, arsenicum may have accomplished more harm than good in the hands of homoeopathic practitioners. No remedy has been more frequently given in acute affections of the bowels, while it is not the most frequently indicated, and it is not a remedy to be unwisely used. The symptoms which most clearly distinguish it from other remedies with a similar totality, are the characteristic thirst and restlessness. These two must be present, as a general rule. The mucous stools are not usually offensive ; the watery ones are very much so, and often pain-

Sleepiness with restlessness ; starting up suddenly. 

The pains appear and disappear suddenly. 

Belladonna will be found suitable for children more frequently than adults. It is often the only remedy required for severe cases of infantile dysentery. The drowsiness, with startings, dry heat, and frequent drinking, may be regarded as characteristic, if the other symptoms of the patient correspond. 

14. BAPTISIA TINCT.

Accompaniments : Nausea, with thirst. Dry tongue. Pain in the region of the liver, and particularly of the gall-bladder ; worse on walking. Fever slight, pulse soft and full. Sleeplessness ; or sleep with heavy, tiresome dreams.

The symptoms of benz. ac. are not many, but they are genuine jewels. The offensive stools are not like those of any other remedy. The smell is strong, pungent, urinous, somewhat like that of the characteristic ifrine, which is also almost invariably

Belladonna has, doubtless, been often given when borax should have been. The anxious feeling on downward motion is the chief distinction between them, and is peculiar to borax.

Capsicum is one of the royal remedies for dysentery; resembling cantii. much in its symptoms, but differing equally as much, as a comparison will show. When the choice becomes difficult, the drinking after stool "causing shuddering, and the drawing pains in the back after stool, will fix the decision on caps., and distinguish it also from mere. corr. and nux VOM.

Except in cholera, carbo veg. is rarely indicated in the beginning of any acute disease of the bowels ; but in the later stages it may become the only remedy capable of producing a favorable change. It will not often be required in cases that have had good homoeopathic ti'eatment, but much more frequently in those coming from allopathic hands. After it are frequently suitable ars., china., mere. sol., or psor.

Novices often fail with ciiamomilla. It is not adapted to every case of diarrhoea during dentition.

The disposition to felons may be found with the tendency to colic. Whether met with thus or singly, diosc. will usually cure whitlow if taken as soon as the pricking in the finger is felt, and greatly relieve, and hasten the termination, if taken later.

Gumm. gutt. is one of the most important remedies in the treatment of diarrhoea, both acute and chronic, and has also a place in the therapeutics of infantile diarrhoea, and of dysentery. It closely resembles aloes. It may be distinguished, however, by the absence of haemorrhoids, by the rapid expulsion of stool, and by the immediate accompanying symptoms of the stool as italicized above. When well selected, gamboge usually gives a prompt and permanent cure, without subsequent aid from other remedies.

Kali bich. proves of great service in a variety of cases, but chiefly in dysentery, with the characteristic tongue and gelatinous stools. Sometimes, however, with those stools the tongue has nothing peculiar. The morning aggravation will then decide the choice.

Lycop. is one of the noblest monuments to the genius of Hahnemann, as well as one of the most convincing proofs of the homoeopathic doctrines. This innocent substance is developed by potentizing into one of our most valuable remedies for chronic diarrhoea, as met with in weak, chlorotic, dyspeptic, and debilitated persons. The characteristic symptoms are marked, and need no comment. The symptoms of the stool are subordinate. The " chilliness in the rectum," before stool, is a singular but genuine symptom, which further observation may to be characteristic.

Its symptoms, though marked and decided, differ more from other remedies in intensity than in quality, and it requires an observing experience to measure this difference.

According to the published symptoms, nitr. ac. resembles alumina, but those symptoms are not confirmed by clinical observation. The appetite for chalk, lime, and similar substances obstinately refuses to j r ield to this remedy, and we are glad to notice that this symptom is not found in Hahnemann's proving. As one of the remedies having green mucous stools, it should be studied in infantile diarrhoea, particularly after abuse of mercury, or in children of syphilitic parents.

I The stools of phos. are hardly characteristic unless 3 little grains like tallow (they resemble more ague frog spawn, or sago, as we have seen them) should prove to be so. The conditions and accompaniments are, however, very peculiar, and are also constant. They will always be present in more or less completeness when this remedy is indicated, and will render a brilliant cure almost certain, if the remedy is given in a proper dose, and is not repeated after the improvement has fully begun. 

The symptoms of phos. are most frequently met with in chronic cases. It is often well to give a singie dose of a high potency of nux vom. a few 





hours before beginning with phos., particularly in cases coming from allopathic treatment.

There is no remedy so surely indicated by painless cholera morbus, as podoph. The stools are profuse and gushing, each seeming to drain the patient dry, but soon he is full again. There may also be violent cramps. It would seem that it must prove to be the similar to many cases of cholera, but clinical experience in this direction is still wanting. We hope that some of our colleagues, who have the opportunity, will test it in this fearful scourge. In diarrhoeas of infants it ranks also among the first to be referred to. It most resembles calc. c.

Although the dark fluid stool is very characteristic of psor., the very offensive odor is much more so. This alone often indicates it in infantile diarrhoea, or in cholera infantum, whatever may be the stool ; and it will usually produce a favorable change at once, and often complete the cure. Whether derived from purest gold or purest filth, our gratitude for its excellent services forbids us to inquire or care. The 400 th of Jenichen is the only preparation of it, which we have ever tested.

The characteristic perspiration on the head differs from that of the latter remedy in being more general over the whole head and forehead, and in the sour smell. The forehead is also often cold, but becomes warm if lightly covered, which is a very marked symptom of silic.

Sulphur has a very wide range of application, being often required for every kind of loose evacuations, by virtue of its similarity, and also, when not distinctively similar, when the appropriate remedies fail to act, or when the improvement which they produce constantly gives way and the patient gets better and worse.

Stools: Thin, brown fecal; Mucous; Frequent; Scanty; 

Aggravations : In the morning ; After eating and 



108 

THE REMEDIES AND 

Before Stool : Pain in the left side of the abdon, with perspiration : Griping pains ; Sore pain the intestines: 

During Stool : Pain in the abdomen continues: 

Tenesmus: Chills in the back: 

After Stool : Tenesmus : Prolapsus ani: Burning in the anus : Great debility : Weakness in the knees ; 

Bmpaniments: Fainting on rising up. Loss tite. 

There has been as yet but little clinical experience with thrombidium. It much resembles nux vom., but has marked and distinctive differences, which must render it a serviceable addition to the materia medica. 

106. THUJA OCC. 

Stools : Pale-yellow watery ; 

Bbly expelled ; Copious ; gurgling like water bunghole. 

Aggravations : In the morning : After breakfast : After coffee: After fat food : After onions: Periodically returning in the morning, always at the same hour : After vaccination : 

Before Stool : Rattling of flatulence : 

During Stool : Passing of much loud flatus 

After Stool: Debility: 

Accompaniments : Much thirst or violent thirst Drink falls audibly into the stomach. Desire for cold food and drink. Rapid exhaustion, causing oppressed and short breath ; irregular and intermittent pulse. Rapid emaciation. 



THEIR INDICATIONS. 

109 

It will hardly be easy to make a niis+ake about thuja. No other remedy has the same combination of symptoms. Gratiola resembles it more than any other, but is easily distinguished by the aggravations and accompaniments of thuja. This remedy is applicable to chronic diarrhoea, particularly when traceable to vaccination, and should not be forgotten in cholera morbus, or in cholera infantum. In the latter affections it has a close resemblance to LAUROCERASUS. 

107. VERATRUM ALBUM. 

Stools: Greenish watery i , with flakes ; Brownish watery ; Blackish watery ; Bloody; Frequent; Profuse, {watery) ; 

Involuntary, (while passing flatus) ; 

I Aggravations : In hot weather: During menstruon: During typhoid fever: At night: By moving d drinking, (vomiting) : 

Before Stool : Severe pinching colic : 

Euring Stool: Paleness: Cold sweat on the fore- I: Pinching colic: Nausea: Vomiting: Weak: Chilliness and shuddering : 

R Stool : Great sinking and empty feeling in men : Weakness. 

Accompaniments : Melancholy. Despair. Vertigo with cold perspiration on the forehead. Hippocratic countenance. Cold, pale, or bluish face and lips. Sunken eyes. Lips dry and dark. Tongue cold, or coated white, with red tip and edges, or

\s yJ *!¦ I J \J TV , V/l ' jf dill Xjl. ll V l\\ \I . AJ j CD JII L y \J L putrid taste. No appetite, or good appetite. Violent third for large quantities of very cold water and acid drinks. Desire for fruits : for acids. Violent nausea with ptyalism. Violent vomiting ;of froth, ; of ingesta ; of green mucus ; of dark-green or yellow-green mucus; of sour mucus; of bile. Before vomiting, cold hands, becoming hot afterward. Great weakness after vomiting. Pressure in the pit of the stomach. Painful retraction of the abdomen during vomiting. Hoarse, weak voice. Oppressive and spasmodic contractions of the chest. Cold breath. Suppression of urine. 

Bssive anguish, arresting the breathing. Exweakness. Fainting. 

Violent cramps of the extremities. 

Skin cold, blue, remaining in folds when pinched. 

Veratrum is a remedy of great value, and one very often required, but like all others it demands a careful selection, and is not to be given in every case of cholera morbus or of cholera. The most characteristic symptoms are the same in both cases, only more violent in the latter. The immediate accompaniments of the stool, with the thirst and cravings, distinguish this remedy. It is useless to give verat.

108. ZINGIBER. 

Stools : Brown mucous ; 

Ejgravations : After drinking impure water : After ig a chill from a cold, damp wind : After derangthe stomach : In the morning : (After eating ns) : After sleep, (nausea) : 

Before Stool : Pinching colic. 

During Stool : Passing of much flatus : 

After Stool : Nausea. 

Accompaniments: Acidity of the stomach. Pains in the stomach. The taste of all food remains in the mouth for hours, particularly of bread or toast. Bad, slimy taste. Frequent eructations. Thirst. Much flatulency, causing rumbling and rolling in the bowels. Nausea. 

¦lorrhoidal tumors, hot, and painfully sore, r sitting or lying. 

If the symptoms of zingiber be further confirmed by clinical observation, it will fill an important place in our therapia. The aggravations are peculiar, particularly the aggravation from drinking impure water
